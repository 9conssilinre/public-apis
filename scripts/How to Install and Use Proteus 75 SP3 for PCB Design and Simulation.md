## Using Proteus 7.5 SP3
 
To use Proteus 7.5 SP3, you need to launch it from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You will see two main applications: ARES 7 Professional and ISIS 7 Professional.
 
ARES 7 Professional is the PCB layout tool that allows you to design and edit your PCBs with various components, tracks, pads, vias, etc. You can also perform design rule checks, autorouting, copper pouring, etc.
 
ISIS 7 Professional is the schematic capture and circuit simulation tool that allows you to draw and test your circuits with various components, wires, sources, probes, etc. You can also perform mixed-mode simulation, debugging, virtual instrumentation, etc.
 
To demonstrate how to use Proteus 7.5 SP3, we will create a simple LED blinking circuit with an Arduino Uno board and simulate it in ISIS 7 Professional.

1. In ISIS 7 Professional, click on "New Project" from the toolbar or the File menu.
2. Enter a name for your project (e.g., LED\_Blink) and choose a location to save it. Click "OK".
3. In the Project Explorer window, right-click on "Schematic Capture" and select "New Schematic Sheet".
4. In the Schematic Editor window, click on "P" from the toolbar or the Place menu to open the Pick Devices dialog box.
5. Type "Arduino Uno" in the search box and select it from the list. Click "OK".
6. Place the Arduino Uno board on your schematic 0f148eb4a0
