One of the main attractions of PES 2018 is its stunning graphics, powered by Konami's Fox Engine. The game boasts lifelike player models, expressive faces, realistic animations and dynamic lighting. The game also has a slower and more deliberate pace, which makes strategy and tactics more important. The controls are fluid and responsive, allowing you to pull off elegant moves and pro-level plays with ease.
 
PES 2018 is available in 17 different languages, making it accessible to a global audience. However, one of the drawbacks of the game is its lack of licenses. Unlike its rival FIFA, PES does not have the rights to use many team names and related content, which means you will only find a handful of authentic teams and players in the game. This may be disappointing for some fans who want to play with their favorite clubs and stars.
 
Despite this limitation, PES 2018 is still a great soccer game that offers a lot of fun and challenge for soccer enthusiasts. If you are looking for a realistic soccer simulator for PC, you should give PES 2018 a try.

If you want to improve your skills and master the game, you will need to learn some tips and tricks that can give you an edge over your opponents. Here are some of the most useful ones:
 
- Use Random Selection Mode to get used to changing tactics. This mode allows you to play with random teams and players, which can help you adapt to different situations and formations. You can also experiment with different strategies and see how they affect the game flow. For example, you can try to overload the opposition box with attackers, or switch to a more defensive approach if you are leading.
- Learn tricks, but don't overuse them. Tricks can be useful to beat a defender or create space, but they can also backfire if you do them at the wrong time or place. For example, don't do a trick when you have already passed the full back, or when you are near your own goal. Learn the tricks and use them wisely, but don't show off too much.
- Don't just play as the best teams. Playing as the top teams and players can be fun, but it won't help you improve your skills or challenge yourself. Try playing as lower level teams or players from time to time, and see how you cope with their strengths and weaknesses. You will learn more about the game mechanics and tactics, and you will also appreciate the differences between players and teams.
- Practice your set pieces. Set pieces can be crucial in deciding the outcome of a match, so you should practice them regularly and master the new control schemes. You can adjust the view and zoom of free kicks and corners, as well as the power and curve of your shots. You can also use different types of passes and crosses, such as low crosses, lofted passes, or driven passes. Experiment with different options and find out what works best for you.
- Use advanced instructions. Advanced instructions are preset tactics that you can activate during a match to change your team's behavior. You can access them from the game plan menu, and assign them to different directions on the D-pad. For example, you can use tiki-taka to increase your passing accuracy and possession, or gegenpress to apply high pressure on your opponents. You can also customize your own advanced instructions by choosing from various options such as attacking styles, defensive styles, support range, compactness, etc.

These are some of the tips and tricks that can help you win in PES 2018. Of course, there are many more aspects of the game that you can explore and master, such as dribbling, shooting, defending, etc. The best way to learn is by playing and practicing, so don't be afraid to try new things and have fun.
